## 🗃️ Database Schema: Crafted for Perfection

Launchpad's data is meticulously organized into several tables within the SQLite database, each serving a specific purpose:

1. 👥 **User**: Store user information like ID, username, avatar, bot status, join timestamp, and moderation counts. 📝
2. 🖥️ **Server**: Manage server-specific settings such as name, icon, prefix, language, and role/channel IDs for moderation. ⚙️
3. 🛡️ **Moderations**: Keep track of moderation actions (warnings, kicks, mutes, bans) with detailed information. 🚨
4. ⭐ **Starboards**: Configure starboard settings, including channel ID and minimum stars required for message reposting. ✨
5. 🗓️ **Reminders**: Store user-set reminders with server ID, user ID, reminder text, timestamp, and sent status. ⏰
6. 💡 **Suggestions**: Maintain server suggestions with user ID, suggestion text, message ID, status, and resolution details. 🤔

This schema design ensures data integrity, efficient querying, and scalability for your bot's various features. Customize it to fit your needs! 🛠️

## ⚡ Why SQLite? Embrace the Power! ⚡

By harnessing the might of SQLite, Launchpad gains unparalleled advantages:

2. 🪶 **Lightweight**: With a small footprint, Launchpad is easy to distribute and deploy across different environments. 🚀
3. 🌍 **Cross-Platform**: SQLite is compatible with various operating systems, ensuring seamless bot functionality. 🌐
4. 🔌 **Embedded**: SQLite can be embedded directly into the application, simplifying deployment and reducing dependencies. 🎯
5. 🔒 **Atomic Transactions**: Robust transaction support ensures data integrity and consistency, even in case of crashes. 💪
6. ⚡ **Performance**: For small to medium-sized applications, SQLite offers comparable or better performance than traditional databases. 🚀

With SQLite, Launchpad achieves the perfect balance between functionality and simplicity, making it the ultimate solution for managing moderation and utility features in your Discord servers! 🌟
