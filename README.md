3. 🛡️ **Moderations**: Keep track of moderation actions (warnings, kicks, mutes, bans) with detailed information. 🚨
4. ⭐ **Starboards**: Configure starboard settings, including channel ID and minimum stars required for message reposting. ✨
5. 🗓️ **Reminders**: Store user-set reminders with server ID, user ID, reminder text, timestamp, and sent status. ⏰
6. 💡 **Suggestions**: Maintain server suggestions with user ID, suggestion text, message ID, status, and resolution details. 🤔

This schema design ensures data integrity, efficient querying, and scalability for your bot's various features. Customize it to fit your needs! 🛠️
